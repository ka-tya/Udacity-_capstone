My goal is to learn data science tools and application to real world problems related to healthcare.
Kaggle offers multitude of various datasets, including these related to healthcare.
I picked **<a href ="https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/kuc-hackathon-winter-2018">UCI ML Drug Review dataset</a>**. This dataset was used for the Winter 2018 Kaggle University Club Hackathon and is now publicly available. I chose this dataset for a few reasons:
* This is an open source data. No need to pass test or apply for a license for the data
* The data set is not is a mid size data table, which will allow me to process the data directly on my machine without the need to use could computing 
* It has text fields for NLP application

### Project Goals

After set of eploratory analysis on the data, here are the questions I'd like to answer on this data set
1. *Classification* : What is patient condition based on the review?
2. *Sentiment Analysis* : What reviews are found more useful?
3.

With more time and data available, I'd like to extend my research on symptom similarities of different medications or creating a recommender system of possible illnesses or medications to avoid based on patient medical history. Also  I've oticed that there are generic and brand drugs available - are there any differences between the two.
